# html-css
This is a starter example for a basic front end with products.

It includes the following:
  Block layout for mobile
  2 column layout for larger screens (main & aside)
  Nav bar that links to sections in the page
  Form example with javascript to display values in an alert
  

All the CSS has been merged into 1 file "shopstyle.css" and linked to from the html
That file now contains the style for the overall page, the nav, and the form.

The separate stylesheets can be found in the directories for ease of
copying and reusing, but are not linked to from the html.

The nav-sm-vert.css example file requires javascript to work with the click event instead of 
the pseudoclass :hover on touch devices. That file has been included also.

A javascript file used to display the form values has also been included to demonstrate
retrieving values from a form and checking their type.
